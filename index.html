				<p>Across US there are more than 7000 undergraduate colleges and in 2014, the total undergraduate enrollment in degree-granting postsecondary institutions was 17.3 million students. Undergraduate enrollment is projected to increase 14 percent from 17.3 million to 19.8 million students between 2014 and 2025.</p>
